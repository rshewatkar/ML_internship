### Mobile Phone Pricing  
 
 This project predicts the price range of a mobile phone (Low / Medium / High / Very High) using its features like RAM, battery capacity, processor specs, camera quality, and more. The project applies supervised machine learning models to classify the mobile into one of four price ranges.
 
## Objective

To build a classification model that accurately predicts the price range 
(0: Low Cost, 1: Medium Cost, 2: High Cost, 3: Very High Cost) based on mobile phone specifications.

## Problem Statement

Smartphone manufacturers release a wide variety of models with different feature sets and price points. Predicting the price category of a phone based on its specifications helps in understanding pricing strategies and market positioning.
